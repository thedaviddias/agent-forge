---

## Step 1: Understand the Context

Before generating names, gather essential context:

```
CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
1. What are you building? (book, product, personal brand, company)
2. Who is your audience? (developers, consumers, businesses)
3. What's the primary goal? (sales, authority, community)
4. What's your name/brand already? (existing recognition)
5. Will this be your ONLY project or one of many?
6. Is this a standalone product or part of a larger ecosystem?
```

### Determine the Pattern Type

| Type | Examples | Domain Strategy |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Personal Brand** | jamesclear.com, wesbos.com | YourName.com |
| **Book as Product** | refactoringui.com, eloquentjavascript.net | BookName.com or concept.com |
| **Multi-Book Author** | patterns.addy.ie, prodengineer.org | Topic-specific domains |
| **Company/Tool** | stripe.com, vercel.com | Brandable made-up word |
| **Community/Content** | javascript.info, css-tricks.com | Descriptive + .com/.info |

---

## Step 2: Research Competitors

### For Books:
```
Research 5-10 successful books in your niche:
1. What domains do they use?
2. Is it personal name or book-specific?
3. Do they use .com, .dev, .net, or other?
4. What's the pattern? (short, descriptive, brandable)
5. What do you want to emulate vs avoid?
```

### For Products:
```
Research direct competitors and adjacent tools:
1. What naming conventions dominate?
2. Are they descriptive (stripe.com) or brandable (vercel.com)?
3. What TLDs are standard in this space?
4. Are there naming trends to follow or buck?
```

---

## Step 3: Generate Names Using Frameworks

### Framework A: The Compound
Combine two relevant words.

```
Examples:
- code + academy = codecademy.com
- web + flow = webflow.com
- git + hub = github.com

Pattern: [word1][word2].com
Quality: High if both words are short and common
```

### Framework B: The Modifier
Add a modifier to a core word.

```
Modifiers: get, go, try, use, hey, hi, my, the, up

Examples:
- getdropbox.com (now dropbox.com)
- golang.org
- try figma.com

Pattern: [modifier][word].com or [word][modifier].com
Quality: Medium - can feel generic if overused
```

### Framework C: The Abbreviation
Shorten long words or phrases.

```
Examples:
- practical junior devs → pjd.dev, prac.dev
- frontend checklist → fc.dev, feck.dev
- international business machines → ibm.com

Pattern: First letters or syllable reduction
Quality: High if pronounceable, low if random letters
```

### Framework D: The Foreign Word
Use Latin, Greek, or other roots.

```
Examples:
- nova (new)
- altus (high)
- primus (first)
- ars (art)

Pattern: [latin/greek word].com
Quality: High for international appeal, low if obscure
```

### Framework E: The Abstract/Brandable
Create a unique, memorable made-up word.

```
Examples:
- stripe, vercel, notion, linear

Techniques:
- Remove vowels: flickr, tumblr
- Add suffix: shopify, spotify
- Combine syllables: pinterest (pin + interest)

Pattern: [unique word].com
Quality: High for differentiation, requires marketing investment
```

### Framework F: The Exact Match
Exactly what people search for.

```
Examples:
- javascript.info
- howtogeek.com
- learnpython.org

Pattern: [exact search term].com/.org/.info
Quality: High for SEO, low for brandability
```

---

## Step 4: Quality Score Each Suggestion

Rate every suggestion on a 1-10 scale for:

| Criteria | Weight | Questions |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Length** | High | Under 10 chars? Easy to type? |
| **Memorability** | High | Will they remember it tomorrow? |
| **Pronounceability** | High | Can you say it on a podcast? |
| **Spelling** | Medium | Can they spell it after hearing it? |
| **Uniqueness** | Medium | Distinct from competitors? |
| **TLD Fit** | Low | Does .com/.dev/.io fit the audience? |

**Minimum viable score: 7/10**

---

## Step 5: Present Structured Recommendations

### Format:

```
🎯 ANALYSIS: [Project type determined]
Based on your [book/product/personal brand] and research on [competitors],
here are domain strategies that fit:

## Option 1: [Strategy Name]
[Domain].com
Score: X/10
- Why: [reasoning]
- Pros: [benefits]
- Cons: [drawbacks]
- Availability: Check at [link]

## Option 2: [Strategy Name]
[Domain].com
Score: X/10
- Why: [reasoning]
- Pros: [benefits]
- Cons: [drawbacks]
- Availability: Check at [link]

## Option 3: [Strategy Name]
[Domain].com
Score: X/10
- Why: [reasoning]
- Pros: [benefits]
- Cons: [drawbacks]
- Availability: Check at [link]

🏆 RECOMMENDATION: [Domain]
Rationale: [why this fits best]

Next Steps:
1. Check availability at porkbun.com or namecheap.com
2. Verify social media handles (@domain on X/Twitter, Instagram)
3. Say it out loud 3 times
4. Ask 2 people to spell it after hearing it
5. Register immediately if available
```

## Step 6: Avoid Common Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Suggest:
- Hyphens (hard to communicate)
- Numbers (is it "4" or "four"?)
- Homophones (to/too/two, hear/here)
- Double letters (bookkeeper - easy to misspell)
- Trademarked terms
- Obscure words requiring explanation
- Long domains over 15 characters

### ❌ Don't Claim:
- "This is available" without checking
- "This is the best" without context
- Specific pricing without current data

### ✅ Always:
- Provide reasoning for each suggestion
- Suggest 3-5 quality options, not 20 mediocre ones
- Guide users to verify availability themselves
- Consider the full brand (domain + social handles)
- Think about the 5-year future, not just today

## Example Output (Quality)

**User:** "I need a domain for my junior developer book"

**Research:**
- Competitors: personal domains dominate (wesbos.com, jamesclear.com)
- Exceptions: book-as-product uses book domains (refactoringui.com)
- Your context: single book, direct sales, standalone product

**Analysis:** Book-as-product pattern fits best

**Suggestions:**

## Option 1: The Abbreviation
**jrdevpath.com**
Score: 8/10
- Why: Short, clear, outcome-focused (path to junior dev)
- Pros: 10 chars, memorable, action-oriented
- Cons: "jr" abbreviation might confuse some
- Check: porkbun.com/domain/jrdevpath.com

## Option 2: The Outcome
**firstdevjob.com**
Score: 7/10
- Why: Direct outcome readers want
- Pros: Clear value proposition, SEO-friendly
- Cons: 12 chars, limiting (only about first job)
- Check: porkbun.com/domain/firstdevjob.com

## Option 3: The Concept
**devstart.com**
Score: 8/10
- Why: Universal concept, works in multiple languages
- Pros: Short, brandable, room to grow
- Cons: Generic, might be taken
- Check: porkbun.com/domain/devstart.com

🏆 RECOMMENDATION: **jrdevpath.com**
Rationale: Balances brevity with clarity. "Jr dev" is standard shorthand, "path" implies journey/process which matches book content. Can expand to courses/community later.

## Availability Checking (Manual)

Since automated availability checking requires API keys and rate limits:

**Step 1:** Go to instantdomainsearch.com
**Step 2:** Type each suggestion
**Step 3:** Green = available, Red = taken
**Step 4:** If taken, try variations (add "the", "my", try different TLD)

**Alternative checkers:**
- porkbun.com (clean interface, good prices)
- namecheap.com (reliable, popular)
- domains.google (now Squarespace, simple)
