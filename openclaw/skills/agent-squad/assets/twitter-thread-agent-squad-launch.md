## Twitter Thread: Agent Squad Launch

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Your AI assistant is overwhelmed.

Not because it's bad. Because you're asking ONE thing to be great at research, writing, coding, and strategy—simultaneously.

That's not a workflow. That's a traffic jam.

**Tweet 2:**
Here's what happens when one AI handles everything:

• Context bloat — old tasks compete with new ones
• Mediocre output — optimized for nothing specific  
• Sequential slowdown — one task at a time
• Wrong voice — same tone for docs AND viral tweets

**Tweet 3:**
The alternative? Specialized agents.

🔍 Fury researches obsessively
✍️ Loki writes with edge
📊 Vision optimizes for search
🎯 Jarvis coordinates it all

Each wakes, works, notifies the next, sleeps.

**Tweet 4:**
Real workflow:

Hour 0: You assign task
Hour 1: Research complete
Hour 2: Draft written  
Hour 3: Delivered to you

All while you were in meetings.

---

**Tweet 5:**
Cost surprise: 10 specialized agents often cost LESS than one always-on generalist.

Why? Heartbeat scheduling. Agents wake, work, sleep. You only pay for work done.

---

**Tweet 6:**
Start small:
1. Research agent (finds sources)
2. Writer agent (sharp content)
3. Lead agent (coordinates)

Add specialists as bottlenecks appear.

---

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
One AI is a ceiling.

A squad of specialized agents is a multiplier.
