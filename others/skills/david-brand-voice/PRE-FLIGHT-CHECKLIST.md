# Pre-Flight Content Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before submitting ANY content written for David, you MUST verify:**

## Critical: Check Destination Format

### If for X (Twitter/X Articles):
- **NO Markdown formatting** — X doesn't support *, **, `code`
- Plain text only
- No bold, no italic, no code blocks
- Use CAPS for emphasis
- Plain text URLs

### If for Blog/Medium/LinkedIn:
- Markdown formatting OK

## Hard No's (Auto-Fail If Present)

- [ ] **NO em-dashes (—)** — Search for "—" and remove ALL
- [ ] **NO excessive exclamation marks** — Never 3+ in a row, never 5+ in short post
- [ ] **NO generic openings** — Must start with specific moment, not "In today's..." or "If you're like me..."
- [ ] **NO corporate buzzwords** — synergy, leverage, holistic, paradigm, etc.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Starts with SPECIFIC personal story/failure (not general statement)
- [ ] Uses "I" and "you" naturally throughout
- [ ] Includes personal details (dates, locations, specific numbers)
- [ ] Has short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- [ ] Shows vulnerability or failure (not just successes)
- [ ] Ends with reflection question (not "more to come!")
- [ ] Could only be written by someone with David's specific experiences
- [ ] Tone feels conversational, not corporate
- [ ] Uses emojis sparingly but naturally (if appropriate)

## Validation Steps

1. **Search for em-dashes:** `grep -n "—" file.md` → Must return nothing
2. **Count exclamation marks:** Should be < 5 in short content, < 10 in long
3. **Read opening aloud:** Does it start with a specific moment?
4. **Check for buzzwords:** Scan for corporate language
5. **Verify personal details:** Are there dates, locations, specific numbers?

## If Checklist Fails

**STOP. Do not submit.**

Fix the issues:
1. Remove ALL em-dashes
2. Replace generic opening with specific story
3. Add personal details
4. Break up long paragraphs
5. Include a failure or vulnerability
6. End with specific reflection question

Then re-run checklist.

## Examples

### Bad (FAILS):
```
In today's fast-paced digital world, we all struggle with productivity.
Leveraging the right tools can help you optimize your workflow.
WE DID IT!!! We built an amazing system!!!
```

### Good (PASSES):
```
I spent 3 years telling myself I just needed "better discipline."
The truth? I was terrified. Of failing again.
I built a simple system. It took 2 hours, not 2 months.
```

**Remember:** This checklist prevents David from having to fix your mistakes.
Run it EVERY TIME before submitting content.
